## [1.0.2] - 2018-09-20
### Fixed
- When passing 'null' to the method that initializes the commands' options,
  the threw errors (since PHP 7.1) as the value is checked for its array
  values. This has been fixed. If 'null' is passed (meaning, the parameter
  needs to be skipped), it is replaced with an empty array.

### Changed
- An improvement to the 'link' functionality has been made. Any path entered
  (whether is is the one to the original file/directory or the path to the
  desired symlink) will be checked for its existence and the user will
  be asked on how to continue, if something seems off. For the - probably
  not yet existing - symlink, the parent directory will be checked.
  
## [1.0.1] - 2017-09-02
### Fixed
- The database import parameter 'importFilePath' didn't support all neccessary
  characters (on validation). Added slashes, tilde, and column.

### Changed
- Raised all database processes timeout limit to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
  to allow export / import to take longer when having to deal with large
  databases
